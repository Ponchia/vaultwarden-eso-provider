# Observability

Vaultwarden ESO Provider is a stateless HTTP webhook. It should be
observable as a normal Kubernetes service without exposing vault item
names, properties, secret values, API tokens, or derived keys.

Public error responses are intentionally coarse for the same reason. ESO may
copy webhook error bodies into `ExternalSecret` status or events, so selector
values are not echoed back on failures.

`/v1/resolve` requires a bearer token by default. Authentication failures are
reported as HTTP `401` with the `auth` resolution error class and no token or
selector detail.

## Health Endpoints

The provider exposes dedicated probe endpoints:

| Endpoint | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `/livez` | Process is alive and the HTTP server can respond. |
| `/readyz` | Pod is ready to receive webhook traffic. |
| `/metrics` | Prometheus text exposition. |

`/readyz` returns `503` after graceful shutdown starts.

The Helm chart enables startup, liveness, and readiness probes by default.
Liveness intentionally does not call Bitwarden or Vaultwarden. Upstream outages
should surface as request failures and metrics, not as restart loops.

## Metrics

Metrics are exposed in Prometheus text format with this content type:

```text
text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8
```

Current series:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

Resolution labels are intentionally coarse. They expose classes like
`auth`, `validation`, `policy_denied`, `item_not_found`,
`property_not_found`, `ambiguous_selector`, `ambiguous_document`,
`unsupported_attachment`, `unsupported_shared_item`, `upstream_http`,
`upstream_status`, `upstream_payload`, `request_timeout`, `crypto`,
`key_derivation`, `kdf_parameters`, `sync_payload`, `endpoint`, and
`unsupported_version`. They do not expose vault item IDs, item names, requested
properties, usernames, URLs, or secret values.

## Prometheus Operator

If the Prometheus Operator CRDs are installed, enable the chart's
`ServiceMonitor`:

```yaml
metrics:
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
    interval: 30s
    scrapeTimeout: 10s
```

If `networkPolicy.enabled=true`, make sure the ingress rules allow traffic from
the Prometheus scraper namespace to the provider Service on the `http` port.

## Dashboard And Alerts

Optional examples are included but are not installed by the Helm chart:

- [`../../examples/grafana/vaultwarden-eso-provider-dashboard.json`](../../examples/grafana/vaultwarden-eso-provider-dashboard.json)
  is an importable Grafana dashboard for readiness, request rates, error
  classes, latency, cache refreshes, and cache hit ratio.
- [`../../examples/prometheus/vaultwarden-eso-provider-rules.yaml`](../../examples/prometheus/vaultwarden-eso-provider-rules.yaml)
  is a Prometheus Operator `PrometheusRule` starting point.

Review datasource names, labels, alert severities, thresholds, and routing
before applying them to a real cluster.

## Useful Alerts

Example PromQL starting points:

```promql
bweso_ready == 0
```

```promql
sum(rate(bweso_resolve_requests_total{outcome="error"}[5m])) > 0
```

```promql
time() - bweso_cache_last_success_timestamp_seconds > 600
```

```promql
increase(bweso_cache_stale_serves_total[5m]) > 0
```

```promql
sum(rate(bweso_policy_reloads_total{outcome="failure"}[5m])) > 0
```

```promql
bweso_policy_last_reload_success_age_seconds > 600
```

```promql
sum(rate(bweso_auth_policy_reloads_total{outcome="failure"}[5m])) > 0
```

```promql
bweso_auth_policy_last_reload_success_age_seconds > 600
```

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum(rate(bweso_resolve_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)
)
```
