# Release Readiness Plan

This file records the release-readiness decisions for Vaultwarden ESO Provider.
`v0.3.0` is public, so this document separates the current published baseline
from the rules and automation for future releases.

## Product Shape

The project is an External Secrets Operator webhook provider for
**Vaultwarden** (and self-hosted Bitwarden Password Manager), with Bitwarden
Cloud Password Manager as a secondary supported target. Bitwarden Secrets
Manager is out of scope and is not implemented by Vaultwarden in any case. The
repository, chart, image, and binary have already been renamed to
`vaultwarden-eso-provider` in the `v0.2` release line.

Do not build a native Kubernetes operator during the pre-`v1.0.0` release line.
ESO already owns refresh intervals, target `Secret` lifecycle, deletion
behavior, status conditions, and GitOps integration. A native operator, native
ESO provider, Secrets Store CSI provider, and PushSecret support are later
roadmap items.

## Required For Public Releases

- Repository, binary crate, container image, and Helm chart are named
  `vaultwarden-eso-provider`. Project framing leads with Vaultwarden and
  self-hosted Bitwarden Password Manager; Bitwarden Cloud Password Manager
  is a secondary supported target.
- Require explicit `id:<item-id>` or `name:<item-name>` selectors. Bare
  unprefixed keys are rejected with `400 validation`. Recommend `id:` in
  production.
- Enforce optional provider-side selector policy with exact raw keys and raw key
  prefixes. Empty policy requires an explicit allow-all escape hatch; configured
  policy denies every non-matching key with a redacted `403`. Document that the
  policy is item-key scoped, not property scoped.
- Support ConfigMap-backed selector policy hot reload without fail-open behavior.
- Support custom CA bundles that supplement the bundled WebPKI roots.
- Shed excess concurrent `/v1/resolve` requests with a global concurrency cap.
- Fail selected shared organization items explicitly until organization-key
  decryption is implemented and live-tested.
- Fail `attachment.` and `attachments.` properties explicitly until attachment
  metadata lookup, download, decryption, and mapping are implemented.
- Expose low-cardinality metrics for HTTP requests, resolve outcomes, cache
  hits, cache refreshes, and last successful cache refresh age/timestamp.
- Ship Helm values and schema for selector policy and pod `hostAliases`.
- Provide examples for namespace-local `SecretStore`, warned
  `ClusterSecretStore`, common Kubernetes Secret types, Reloader, and
  NetworkPolicy starting points.
- Provide optional Grafana dashboard and PrometheusRule examples for the
  exported low-cardinality metrics.
- Document the tested migration target policy:
  `creationPolicy: Orphan`, `deletionPolicy: Retain`, and template
  `mergePolicy: Merge`.
- Recommend `field.<key>` for migrated Kubernetes keys to avoid collisions with
  Bitwarden login fields such as `username` and `password`.
- Document intentional empty target keys as ESO template data with
  `mergePolicy: Merge`.
- Keep chart NetworkPolicy opt-in; backend, DNS, ESO, and Prometheus reachability
  is cluster-specific. When enabled, default to deny-all until rules are supplied.
- Publish the packaged Helm chart to GHCR as an OCI chart and attach the same
  chart archive to tagged GitHub Releases after the release image manifest has
  been built, scanned, signed, and attested.

## Current Validation Baseline

The repository baseline is validated with:

- CI gates for formatting, clippy, tests with coverage, Helm rendering,
  markdown linting, observability examples, Gitleaks, Trivy filesystem scanning,
  cargo-deny, Checkov, and Dockerfile build checks.
- CodeQL code scanning for Rust and GitHub Actions workflow files.
- OpenSSF Scorecard runs on `main` and publishes SARIF/code-scanning results.
- Local advisory scans used during release review, including Semgrep and
  SonarQube where available. These are review tools unless they are present in
  the GitHub workflow for that commit.
- `scripts/live-eso-smoke.sh` against Vaultwarden on a k3s cluster with
  selector policy enabled for the `v0.1.3` backend path; `v0.2.x` keeps that
  protocol path and adds automated coverage for the new runtime controls.
- `scripts/live-eso-smoke.sh` against Bitwarden Cloud with selector policy
  enabled for the `v0.1.1` runtime path; releases without provider protocol
  changes may reuse that evidence.
- The current release workflow publishes a multi-arch image, a GHCR OCI Helm
  chart, a packaged Helm chart archive, generated release notes, keyless
  Sigstore signatures, and GitHub artifact attestations from the release commit.
  Do not assume older tags have every evidence artifact unless the exact GitHub
  Release notes list it.
- Public repository controls for branch protection, tag protection, secret
  scanning, Dependabot alerts, security policy, issue templates, and CODEOWNERS.

## Future Release Gate

Releases are maintainer-initiated. Do not tag or publish a release simply
because work has landed on `main`; wait until the maintainer says the current
state is ready to release.

Not every repository change needs a release. Documentation cleanup,
governance-only edits, CI-only maintenance, and source-tree hygiene can land on
`main` without a new tag when the latest published chart and image remain the
recommended installable artifacts.

For each release:

- Run the GitHub CI workflow to green.
- Run the release workflow from the exact tag or commit being released.
- Confirm the release OCI chart and attached chart artifact are published only
  after the image manifest and release image scan succeed.
- Confirm image and chart verification commands in
  [`release-verification.md`](release-verification.md) work for the published
  evidence.
- Run live smoke tests against Vaultwarden and Bitwarden Cloud with selector
  policy enabled when provider runtime behavior changes. Packaging-only releases
  may reuse prior backend live evidence if fake-server coverage and the changed
  packaging path are both verified.
- Record the image index digest, chart checksum, signature, and attestation
  evidence in the GitHub Release notes. Generated artifact hashes should not
  require a follow-up commit after tagging.

## Deferred

- Organization/shared item decryption.
- Attachment support.
- Stale-cache-on-upstream-outage behavior.
- Disposable kind integration that does not require private credentials.
- GitHub Pages chart repository.
- Native operator or native ESO provider.
